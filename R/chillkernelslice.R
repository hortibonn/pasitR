#' Estimated yield given the expected chill, based on a slice of 'z' from the Kernel density plot of chill and yield data.
#'
#' Plot representing probabilities (shown along the y-axis) for the expected yield (shown along the x-axis). 
#' This is a cut through the density kernel from pasitR::chillkernel() function, which integrates to 1, the probability values are relative, not absolute measures.
#' 
#' @param chill is a list of observed seasonal Chill Portions corresponding to another list with annual yields. 
#' @param yield is a list of observed annual yields corresponding to another list with seasonal Chill Portions. 
#' @param expectedchill is a value of expected chill for which the yield should be estimated.
