#' Estimated yield given the expected chill, based on a slice of 'z' from the Kernel density plot of chill and yield data.
#'
#' Plot representing probabilities (shown along the y-axis) for the expected yield (shown along the x-axis). 
#' This is a broad slice through the density kernel from pasitR::chillkernel() function, which integrates to 1, the probability values are relative, not absolute measures.
#' 
#' @param chill is a list of observed seasonal Chill Portions corresponding to another list with annual yields. 
#' @param yield is a list of observed annual yields corresponding to another list with seasonal Chill Portions. 
#' @param max_chill is a value of the highest expected  amount of chill (in Chill Portions) for which the yield should be estimated (must be > expectedlowchill). 
#' @param min_chill is a value of the lowest expected amount of chill (in Chill Portions) for which the yield should be estimated (must be < expectedhighchill).
